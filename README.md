# Neovim
My Neovim setup is rather minimalist, but effective.

## Own your text editor
### Why My Neovim Setup is Minimalist
- About a year ago, I used various Neovim "distributions" like LunarVim and Astro. These distributions came packed with numerous plugins, aiming to emulate VS Code or outdo it in functionality. However, despite their flashy appearances and vast array of features, I never truly grasped how to efficiently use Vim/Neovim. Even with the abundance of plugins, tab bars, and file trees, I found myself struggling to navigate efficiently.

- Then, I decided to craft my own Neovim configuration. By doing so, I became intimately familiar with every aspect of my editor. I no longer had to guess which key bindings or commands to use because they were all custom-tailored by me. I ditched the tab line in favor of using Telescope for buffer searching, along with custom key bindings for navigating between my open buffers. Utilizing plugins like Harpoon for file marking enhanced my workflow even further.

- There's something empowering about using a minimalist, no-frills text editor. It imbues a sense of hacker-like proficiency. Moreover, since every plugin in my setup was added by me, I understand exactly what each one does and why I included it. This extends to the key bindings associated with each plugin.

### Reconsidering Fancy Configurations
- Many, including myself in the past, gravitate towards fancy and bloated Neovim configurations in an attempt to mimic VS Code's feature-rich environment. However, it's worth noting that a significant portion of VS Code's features often go unused by many users. Prioritizing simplicity over feature bloat can lead to a more focused and efficient workflow.

### Muscle Memory and Vim Motions
- Building my own Neovim configuration not only customized my editor to suit my needs but also ingrained the key bindings and Vim motions into my muscle memory. By actively writing and customizing these configurations, I've found that executing commands and navigating files has become second nature, further enhancing my productivity and efficiency.

### Embracing Lua for Neovim Configuration
- The transition to Lua for Neovim configuration can be intimidating for many users, especially those unfamiliar with the language. However, Lua's simplicity and readability make it an accessible choice even for beginners. Projects like "kickstart.nvim" aim to ease this transition by providing a basic Neovim configuration template written in Lua. This repository not only offers a starting point for users to begin customizing their Neovim environment but also encourages understanding and ownership of their editor. With Lua, users can gradually build upon their configuration, tailoring it to their specific needs and preferences.
